  <h2>What Makes Sustainable Choices Better?</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Safe and Non-Toxic:</strong> Protects your baby’s health by avoiding harmful chemicals such as phthalates, BPA, and toxic dyes. Eco-friendly baby products are crafted from natural, non-toxic materials like organic cotton and bamboo, ensuring your baby’s safety and comfort.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Sustainability:</strong> Promotes a cleaner, greener planet for future generations. By choosing eco-friendly products, you're reducing the demand for synthetic materials, plastics, and harmful chemicals, which helps minimize pollution and waste.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Ethical Practices:</strong> Supports fair trade and responsible production. Many eco-conscious brands prioritize fair wages, ethical labor standards, and sustainable manufacturing, ensuring that your purchase contributes positively to both the environment and the people who make the products.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gentle Materials:</strong> Hypoallergenic and comfortable for sensitive baby skin. Organic cotton, bamboo, and wooden products are gentle on delicate skin, reducing the risk of irritation or allergic reactions often caused by synthetic materials.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Durable, reusable products that reduce long-term costs. While eco-friendly baby items may have a higher initial price, their durability and longevity make them a smart investment. Many products, such as organic clothing and wooden toys, can be reused, passed down, or repurposed.
    </li>
